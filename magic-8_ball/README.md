### Magic 8-Ball Script

This project includes a simple implementation of a Magic 8-Ball fortune-telling game in Python. The script provides random answers to yes-or-no questions, simulating the classic toy's responses.

#### Features

- Asks a yes-or-no question.
- Provides one of eight possible answers.
- Includes comments explaining the code.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Magic 8-Ball script, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Running the Script

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/datanerd96/python-projects.git
### Navigate to the Repository Directory:

```bash
cd python-projects

###Run the Magic 8-Ball script:

bash

python magic_8_ball.py

###Example Output

When you run the script, you will see output similar to:



Jedidja asks: Are you going to pass the exam?
Magic 8-Ball's answer: Yes - definitely

### Code Explanation

The script uses the `random` module to generate a random number between 1 and 9. Based on this number, it provides one of eight possible responses to simulate the Magic 8-Ball toy. The responses are:

- "Yes - definitely"
- "It is decidedly so"
- "Without a doubt"
- "Reply hazy, try again"
- "Ask again later"
- "Better not tell you now"
- "My sources say no"
- "Outlook not so good"
